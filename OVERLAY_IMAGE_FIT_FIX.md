# Overlay Image Fit Options Fix

## Problem
The image fit options under Overlay Image were not working correctly. The three options (Fill, Cover, Contain) were not properly implemented in the overlay plugin. Additionally, when uploading an image initially, the border was placed at the top-left corner instead of covering the image size correctly.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `afterDraw` method of the overlay plugin (`lib/overlay-plugin.ts`). The method was using a simple `ctx.drawImage(img, x, y, w, h)` call instead of using the sophisticated `drawImageOnCanvas` function that properly handles the image fitting options.

Additionally, the border drawing code was using inconsistent dimensions:
- Circle shapes used `renderWidth` and `renderHeight` (correct)
- Rectangle and rounded shapes used `image.width` and `image.height` (incorrect)

## Solution
Updated the `afterDraw` method to use the `drawImageOnCanvas` function which properly implements image fitting, and fixed the border drawing to use consistent dimensions.

### Before (Broken):
```typescript
// Image is loaded, draw it
ctx.save()
clipImageToShape(ctx, x, y, w, h, image.shape)
ctx.drawImage(img, x, y, w, h)
ctx.restore()

// Border drawing (inconsistent)
if (image.shape === 'circle') {
  // Used renderWidth/renderHeight (correct)
} else if (image.shape === 'rounded') {
  // Used image.width/image.height (incorrect)
} else {
  // Used image.width/image.height (incorrect)
}
```

### After (Fixed):
```typescript
// Image is loaded, draw it using the sophisticated drawImageOnCanvas function
drawImageOnCanvas(ctx, img, image, chartArea)

// Border drawing (consistent)
if (image.shape === 'circle') {
  // Uses renderWidth/renderHeight (correct)
} else if (image.shape === 'rounded') {
  // Uses renderWidth/renderHeight (fixed)
} else {
  // Uses renderWidth/renderHeight (fixed)
}
```

## Image Fit Options Implementation

The `drawImageOnCanvas` function properly implements the three image fit options:

### 1. Fill
- Stretches the image to fill the entire container
- May distort the aspect ratio
- Uses the full container dimensions

### 2. Cover
- Maintains aspect ratio while covering the entire container
- May crop parts of the image
- Scales the image to cover the container completely

### 3. Contain
- Maintains aspect ratio while fitting inside the container
- Never crops the image
- May leave empty space in the container

## Code Changes Made

1. **File**: `lib/overlay-plugin.ts`
   - **Lines**: 530-540
   - **Change**: Replaced simple `ctx.drawImage()` call with `drawImageOnCanvas()` function call
   - **Impact**: Now uses the sophisticated image fitting logic

2. **File**: `lib/overlay-plugin.ts`
   - **Lines**: 540-545
   - **Change**: Added missing variable declarations for placeholder rendering
   - **Impact**: Fixed syntax errors and improved placeholder rendering

3. **File**: `lib/overlay-plugin.ts`
   - **Lines**: 440-445
   - **Change**: Fixed border drawing to use consistent dimensions (`renderWidth`/`renderHeight`)
   - **Impact**: Borders now correctly match the image container size for all shapes

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. Open the chart builder application
2. Go to the "Overlay" panel
3. Add an image overlay
4. Try the different "Image Fit" options:
   - **Fill**: Should stretch the image to fill the area
   - **Cover**: Should cover the area while maintaining aspect ratio
   - **Contain**: Should contain the image without overflowing
5. Verify that the border correctly surrounds the image from the initial upload

## Files Modified

- `lib/overlay-plugin.ts` - Fixed the image rendering logic to use proper image fitting and consistent border dimensions

## Verification

The fix ensures that:
- ✅ Fill option stretches images to fill the container
- ✅ Cover option maintains aspect ratio while covering the container
- ✅ Contain option maintains aspect ratio while fitting inside the container
- ✅ All options work with different image shapes (rectangle, circle, rounded)
- ✅ Border rendering correctly matches the image container size
- ✅ Borders appear correctly from initial image upload
- ✅ Image loading and caching still works correctly
